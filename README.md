# MockLab

MockLab is a small but feature-complete mocking framework for Matlab.

Important: MockLab is under construction: it is not feature complete, interfaces are not fixed and it is not tested!

As Matlab R2017a is shipped with its own mocking framework, MockLab can be used for Matlab versions earlier than R2017a, or as an auxillary framework for R2017a as MockLab provides the possibility to mock and stub functions (not just objects) to support legacy code.
